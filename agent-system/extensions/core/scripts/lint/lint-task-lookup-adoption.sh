# lint-task-lookup-adoption.sh - Detect hand-rolled full-record task-lookup jq shapes across the
# source store, on executable surfaces only.
#
# Two canonical implementations already do this lookup:
#   - skill_validate_input() in scripts/skill-base.sh (skill layer; a skill's own bash block
#     calls it after `source .../skill-base.sh`; exports TASK_DATA, TASK_TYPE, TASK_STATUS,
#     PROJECT_NAME, PADDED_NUM, TASK_DIR, TASK_DIR_ABS; `exit 1` on not-found/terminal status).
#   - gate_in() in scripts/command-gate-in.sh (command layer; sourced with two positional args;
#     exports SESSION_ID, TASK_TYPE, TASK_STATUS, PROJECT_NAME, DESCRIPTION, PADDED_NUM; `return 1`
#     on failure; also does locking, session registration, and the deploy-freshness warning).
# They are NOT interchangeable -- different export sets, different exit-vs-return semantics -- so
# this lint targets the literal duplication of their shared *shape*, not a call to unify them.
#
# The class this lint prevents from regrowing: a fresh skill or command hand-rolling
#   jq '.active_projects[] | select(.project_number == $num)' specs/state.json
# instead of calling one of the two helpers above. Copy-pasting that line is easy; this lint
# fails loudly when the literal narrow shape reappears anywhere under agent-system/extensions/.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION (stated plainly rather than papered over)
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# This is a regex-only, line-oriented content lint. It therefore CANNOT catch:
#   - A variable-indirected lookup, e.g. a filter assembled into `$FILTER` on one line and used
#     on another; nothing in the source text of either line names the literal shape.
#   - A lookup whose `select(...)` clause spans more than one physical line (the balanced-paren
#     scan below only walks the single line a match was found on).
#   - A lookup performed by a helper the lint has no reason to suspect, or by any non-.md/.sh
#     artifact.
# This lint is a guardrail against regression and recurrence of the literal anti-pattern text. It
# is NOT a proof of absence of every possible hand-rolled task lookup. Treat a clean run as "the
# known bad shape is not present", never as "every task lookup goes through a canonical helper".
#
# DETECTION MODEL
# ---------------
# Two layers, applied in order:
#
#   Layer 1 (structural, line shape): every line containing the broad candidate pattern
#     `.active_projects[] | select(.project_number ==` (the equality comparison both canonical
#     helpers use -- a select on `.project_number` that does something else, e.g. an `as $pn |
#     ... index ...` membership test across a candidate list, is a structurally different
#     operation and is not a candidate at all) is classified by what surrounds the
#     `select(...)` clause (balanced-paren scan on that single line). VIOLATION is the narrow
#     full-record lookup: the filter terminates right after `select(...)` with nothing
#     meaningful piped after it -- the exact shape both canonical helpers implement. Four
#     legitimate shapes are EXEMPT by construction, each with its own reason: deletion
#     (`del(...)` wraps the lookup), in-place mutation (`|=`, `+=`, or a bare `.field =`
#     assignment follows), existence/length check (`[...] | length`), and single-field/complex
#     read (any further pipe, or `(...).field`, follows). A `select(...)` clause left unclosed
#     on its line cannot be safely classified and is treated as EXEMPT (see KNOWN LIMITATION).
#
#   Layer 2 (file-level allowlist): a short, explicitly-reasoned list of files that legitimately
#     contain the narrow shape today -- the two canonical implementations, plus current
#     migration-pending offenders. Every entry carries its reason inline; there are no bare paths
#     on that list by design. The allowlist is expected to shrink as sites migrate; adding an
#     entry is a deliberate act, not the default response to a failing run.
#
# Scan scope: `*.sh` across each extension's `scripts/` tree (excluding `scripts/tests/*.sh` and
# `scripts/deprecated/*.sh` by directory), plus `*.md` scoped ONLY to `commands/`, `skills/`,
# `agents/` subdirectories. `docs/`, `context/`, `rules/` are out of scope by construction, never
# by an exclusion list -- illustrative prose in those directories is never a lint target.
#
# Usage: lint-task-lookup-adoption.sh [--verbose] [--quiet] [path...]
#
#   path...    Optional. Files or directories to scan. A directory is scanned per the scope rules
#              above. Defaults to the resolved project root's source-store or deployed scan roots
#              (see root resolution below).
#   --verbose  Report every candidate line found, including exempt ones, tagged with the reason
#              each was exempted. Mirrors lint-state-writer-boundary.sh's --verbose semantics.
#   --quiet    Suppress the progress header and the all-clear summary. Violations are still
#              printed, and the failing summary is still printed, so a failing run is never
#              silent.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - No unexcluded violations found
#   1 - One or more unexcluded violations found (each printed as file:line plus the matched text)
#   2 - Script error (unresolvable project root, missing shared library, unreadable scan path)
