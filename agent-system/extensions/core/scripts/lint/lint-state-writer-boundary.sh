# lint-state-writer-boundary.sh - Detect hand-rolled state.json writes across the source store.
#
# scripts/state-write.sh is the single mutex-guarded writer for specs/state.json and its
# archive/vault counterparts. Every read-modify-write of a state file is meant to go through it
# rather than hand-rolling the historical `jq '<filter>' specs/state.json > <staging-path> && mv
# <staging-path> specs/state.json` sequence. That hand-rolled sequence is unsafe on two
# independent axes -- it acquires no specs/.scope-lock mutex, so concurrent writers interleave and
# lose updates; and it stages through a fixed, shared temp path, so one process's cleanup can
# delete another's in-flight staging file. See state-write.sh's own header for the full account of
# both corruption channels.
#
# Converting the surviving hand-rolled writers is a one-time migration. Keeping them converted is
# not: every new command file or skill that needs to touch state is a fresh opportunity to
# copy-paste the old sequence from a neighbouring file. This lint is the guardrail against that
# regression -- it fails loudly when the literal anti-pattern text reappears anywhere under
# agent-system/extensions/.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION (stated plainly rather than papered over)
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# This is a regex-only, line-oriented content lint. It matches the *literal shape* of the
# anti-pattern in the text of .md and .sh files. It therefore CANNOT catch:
#   - A variable-indirected write, e.g. a site that stages through `$STAGING` or `$STATE_FILE`
#     where the path is only resolved at runtime; nothing in the source text names `state.json`
#     or a `.tmp` staging path, so no regex can see it.
#   - A write assembled across more than the one-or-two adjacent lines the heuristics below read
#     (a filter built into a variable on line 10 and redirected on line 40).
#   - A write performed by a helper the lint has no reason to suspect, or by any non-.md/.sh
#     artifact.
# This lint is a guardrail against regression and recurrence of the literal anti-pattern text. It
# is NOT a proof of absence of every possible hand-rolled state write. Treat a clean run as "the
# known bad shape is not present", never as "all state writes go through state-write.sh".
#
# DETECTION MODEL
# ---------------
# Two layers, applied in order to every line matching the broad candidate pattern:
#
#   Layer 1 (structural, line shape): classifies each candidate line by the shape of the write.
#     A redirect whose target is /dev/null is a read-only existence check, not a write. A bare
#     `mv` onto a state.json target is a violation only when its SOURCE looks like a staging path
#     (contains a tmp component or a .tmp suffix) -- a `mv .../archive/state.json .../state.json`
#     file relocation is not a staged read-modify-write and is exempt by shape.
#
#   Layer 2 (file-level allowlist): a short, explicitly-reasoned list of files that legitimately
#     contain the pattern text. Every entry carries its reason inline below; there are no bare
#     paths on that list by design.
#
# Usage: lint-state-writer-boundary.sh [--verbose] [--quiet] [path...]
#
#   path...    Optional. Files or directories to scan. A directory is scanned recursively for
#              .md and .sh files. Defaults to $PROJECT_ROOT/agent-system/extensions (the source
#              store -- .claude/ is a disposable generated deploy artifact and is never the
#              correct place to fix a finding).
#   --verbose  Report every candidate line found, including exempt ones, tagged with the reason
#              each was exempted. Mirrors lint-postflight-boundary.sh's --verbose semantics.
#   --quiet    Suppress the progress header and the all-clear summary. Violations are still
#              printed, and the failing summary is still printed, so a failing run is never
#              silent.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - No unexcluded hits found
#   1 - One or more unexcluded hits found (each printed as file:line plus the matched text)
#   2 - Script error (unresolvable project root, missing shared library, unreadable scan path)
