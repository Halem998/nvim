# lint-branch-gated-sections.sh - Detect marked-but-unextracted branch-gated sections above a
# byte threshold on runtime-loaded executable `.md` surfaces.
#
# Companion enforcement for context/patterns/mode-gated-section-loading.md: a skill's SKILL.md
# body and a command's .md body load in full on every invocation (no include/partial mechanism,
# deploy is a byte-for-byte copy), so a large mutually-exclusive branch section left inline is
# paid for on every invocation that skips it. Authors mark such a section with the paired
#   <!-- branch-gated:begin condition="..." --> ... <!-- branch-gated:end -->
# comment pair while deciding whether/how to extract it. This lint fires when a marked section
# (or the sum of several in one file) exceeds the byte threshold below, so the marked-but-
# unextracted state does not linger silently.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION (stated plainly rather than papered over)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# This is a marker-keyed lint. It can only ever see sections an author has already wrapped in
# the branch-gated:begin/end marker pair. A genuinely large, mutually-exclusive branch section
# that was never marked evades this lint entirely -- there is nothing in the unmarked prose for
# a structural scan to key on. A clean run means "no MARKED section exceeds the threshold", never
# "no branch-gated section is inline anywhere in the tree". See mode-gated-section-loading.md's
# "When to Extract" section for the authoring-time guidance that is this lint's only defense
# against that blind spot.
#
# THRESHOLD CALIBRATION
# ----------------------
# THRESHOLD_BYTES=8000 sits below every known instance measured at authoring time (17,309 /
# 25,883 / 43,254 / 65,772 / 103,462 B) by a wide margin, so it needs no re-tuning as those land,
# and above small legitimately-inline branch content whose extraction overhead (new file,
# pointer, index entry) would exceed the win. It is a single named constant specifically so a
# future re-calibration is a one-line change, not a structural one.
#
# CONVENTION-SELECTION (structural-plus-reasoned-allowlist, not zero-tolerance)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A live count of marked-but-unextracted files across the tree at authoring time came back ZERO
# (no markers exist anywhere yet). Despite that, this lint deliberately adopts the
# structural-plus-reasoned-allowlist shape rather than zero-tolerance: per-file extraction work
# (see context/patterns/mode-gated-section-loading.md's extraction procedure) legitimately
# produces a marked-but-unextracted intermediate state as a routine, expected step -- the marker
# is applied BEFORE the section is cut out, specifically so boundaries can be re-located by
# literal text. A zero-tolerance assertion would make that ordinary in-progress state a hard
# failure for every future extraction, this task's own pilot included. The allowlist mechanism
# below is present but starts EMPTY -- there is no known standing exception at authoring time --
# per the decision rule in context/patterns/adoption-lint-conventions.md. A future entry is a
# deliberate act with a stated reason, never the default response to a failing run.
#
# DETECTION MODEL
# -----------------
# Two layers, applied in order:
#
#   Layer 1 (structural): for each in-scope file, pair every
#     <!-- branch-gated:begin condition="..." --> with the NEXT <!-- branch-gated:end -->,
#     encountered in a single top-to-bottom pass. Malformed marker states are reported as their
#     own named diagnostic, never silently skipped:
#       - UNMATCHED_BEGIN: a begin marker with no following end marker before EOF.
#       - UNMATCHED_END: an end marker with no preceding open begin marker.
#       - NESTED: a second begin marker encountered while a prior begin is still open.
#     For each well-formed pair, the span's byte size is measured with `sed -n '<start>,<end>p'
#     <file> | wc -c` (start/end are the marker lines themselves, so the measured span includes
#     both marker lines and everything between them). A file's violation total is the SUM of all
#     its well-formed spans' byte sizes -- multiple sections each below threshold that sum above
#     it is still a violation, not just the single largest section.
#
#   Layer 2 (file-level allowlist): an EXCLUDED_FILES-style block, identical in shape to
#     lint-task-lookup-adoption.sh's -- every entry carries an inline reason; bare paths are
#     prohibited by construction. Starts empty per the CONVENTION-SELECTION note above.
#
# Scope, by construction (never by exclusion list): `commands/*.md` (top-level only) and
# `skills/*/SKILL.md` (exactly one skill-directory level deep) across each extension.
# `docs/`, `context/`, `rules/`, `agents/`, and any `scripts/*.sh` are out of scope because the
# scan never visits them -- illustrative marker examples in prose documentation (such as this
# lint's own header, or mode-gated-section-loading.md's worked examples) are never scan targets.
#
# Usage: lint-branch-gated-sections.sh [--verbose] [--quiet] [path...]
#
#   path...    Optional. Directories to scan (each treated as its own scan root, mode-probed
#              independently) or individual files (scanned directly, bypassing scope rules).
#              Defaults to the resolved project root's source-store or deployed scan roots.
#   --verbose  Report every well-formed span found, including those under threshold or
#              allowlist-exempted, tagged with its byte size and disposition.
#   --quiet    Suppress the progress header and the all-clear summary. Violations are still
#              printed, and the failing summary is still printed, so a failing run is never
#              silent.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - No unexcluded violations found (no over-threshold sum, no malformed markers)
#   1 - One or more unexcluded violations found
#   2 - Script error (unresolvable project root, missing shared library, unreadable scan path)
