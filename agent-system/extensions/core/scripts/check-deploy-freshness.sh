# check-deploy-freshness.sh — Non-blocking, always-exit-0 check for whether a repo's deployed
# .claude/ tree still matches the source store it was regenerated from.
#
# ALWAYS EXITS 0. This is not a preflight gate: it never changes an admission decision, never
# aborts, retries, or auto-redeploys anything. Its two sanctioned consumers: (1)
# command-gate-in.sh's CHECKPOINT 1, which invokes it as
# `bash .claude/scripts/check-deploy-freshness.sh ... 2>&1 || true` for exactly that reason, and
# (2) scripts/lib/deploy-freshness-lib.sh, the shared comparison library this script sources
# below — its own second exported function (`deploy_freshness_status`) is the blocking companion
# tier described in `context/patterns/regeneration-is-manual-only.md`'s "Detecting When You're
# Stale" section (tier 2: `update-task-status.sh`'s postflight backstop). This script itself
# remains tier 1: silent, advisory, CHECKPOINT-1-only, never a gate.
# MUST be run with `bash`, never sourced — it sets no shell options safe to inherit into a
# caller's shell, and exports nothing a caller could rely on.
#
# Reads <repo_root>/.claude-extensions.json (default repo_root: current directory). For each
# extension entry recording BOTH `source_dir` and `source_git_head`, recomputes the path-scoped
# source-store revision the same way the Lua write side does (state.lua's
# `resolve_source_git_head`: resolve the enclosing repo root via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`,
# then `git log -1 --format=%H -- <source_dir>`). A mismatch between the recorded and recomputed
# revision prints one WARN line to stderr naming the extension and the regeneration remedy. The
# actual per-extension comparison is delegated to scripts/lib/deploy-freshness-lib.sh
# (`deploy_freshness_stale_names`) — this script owns only the WARN line text/formatting and its
# always-exit-0 contract; it does not re-derive the comparison algorithm inline.
#
# Deliberately SILENT (no output at all, not even a summary line) in every "cannot verify" case
# — "unknown" must not read as either "confirmed fresh" or an alarm:
#   - missing or unparseable .claude-extensions.json
#   - an entry missing `source_dir` or `source_git_head` (every pre-fix deploy)
#   - `source_dir` does not exist on disk
#   - `source_dir` is not inside a git repository
#   - `git` or `jq` is unavailable
#   - the recomputed revision is empty
#
# This is the shallow, preflight-cheap companion to verify-deploy.sh (11 content-diffing gates,
# deliberately NOT preflight-cheap): one path-scoped `git log -1` per extension, safe to run on
# every ordinary command.
#
# --- Consecutive-ignore escalation (TIER 1 remains non-blocking; this is presentation only) ---
# A per-repo WARN nobody acts on is not functioning as a warning. This script tracks a
# consecutive-invocation streak counter at <repo_root>/specs/.freshness-warn-streak.json
# (ephemeral runtime file — see context/standards/orchestrator-runtime-files.md's class table):
# incremented each time this script fires at least one WARN, reset (file deleted) the moment a
# run fires none. At streak >= 5, an additional escalated banner is printed (on top of, never
# instead of, the existing per-extension WARN lines) naming the consecutive count and the
# remedy. Below the threshold, output is byte-identical to before this feature existed. The
# counter is a consecutive COMMAND-INVOCATION count, not wall-clock days, since this check only
# ever fires on an invocation. A CANNOTVERIFY result also resets the counter — this script's
# STALE_NAMES already deliberately collapses FRESH and CANNOTVERIFY into the same silence (see
# the "Deliberately SILENT" block above), and the streak counter inherits that same collapse
# rather than introducing a third distinction. All counter I/O is best-effort and silently
# skipped when <repo_root>/specs/ does not exist, is not writable, or jq is unavailable — this
# script's `set -uo pipefail` / always-`exit 0` contract is never put at risk by it.
#
# Usage: bash check-deploy-freshness.sh [repo_root]
# Exit code: always 0.
