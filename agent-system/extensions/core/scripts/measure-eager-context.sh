#!/usr/bin/env bash
# measure-eager-context.sh - PREDICTS the session-start eager context set from the SOURCE STORE
# alone, plus a modeled regenerate, and reports bytes / bytes-4 token estimates per contributing
# source and in total.
#
# WHY "PREDICT", NEVER "MEASURE THE DEPLOYED TREE": the deployed `.claude/` tree is a disposable
# build artifact (see .claude/rules/source-store-deploy-boundary.md) that routinely lags the
# source store. A script that read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/rules/*.md` directly would
# silently report a stale number the moment any source-store edit landed without an intervening
# redeploy -- exactly the staleness this harness exists to eliminate as a dependency. This script
# therefore reads ONLY agent-system/extensions/** and the project-root state files
# (.claude-extensions.json, the two parent-chain CLAUDE.md files) and MODELS what a regenerate
# would produce by replicating generate_claudemd() (lua/neotex/plugins/ai/shared/extensions/
# merge.lua:768-879) directly in bash.
#
# HARD POLICY CONSTRAINT -- DO NOT "FIX" THIS BY SHELLING OUT: this script MUST NOT invoke
# deploy-headless.sh or nvim (headless or otherwise) to obtain a "real" regenerate.
# context/patterns/regeneration-is-manual-only.md licenses exactly ONE automated caller of
# deploy-headless.sh (skill-orchestrate Stage MT-3); this script is not it, and adding a call here
# would be an out-of-policy new automated caller as well as reintroducing the exact
# deployed-tree/staleness dependency this harness exists to remove.
#
# FOUR CHANNELS MEASURED (see context/architecture/context-layers.md's "Eager vs. Lazy Loading
# Channels" for the canonical description each channel implements):
#   1. parent_chain  - the native CLAUDE.md chain Claude Code walks upward (parent ~/.config/
#                       CLAUDE.md, this repo's root CLAUDE.md). Always eager, unconditionally.
#   2. claudemd      - the PREDICTED assembled `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, computed by replicating
#                       generate_claudemd()'s algorithm against source-store files: read active
#                       extensions from .claude-extensions.json (sorted, core pulled to front),
#                       resolve each extension's merge_targets.claudemd.source from its own
#                       manifest.json, prepend core/templates/claudemd-header.md UNTRIMMED when
#                       core is active, right-trim every fragment (matching Lua's
#                       fragment:gsub("%s+$", "") -- fragments only; the header itself is never
#                       trimmed), join with "\n\n", append one trailing "\n". This is materialized
#                       in a scratch file and measured with `wc -c` rather than computed by
#                       hand-rolled byte arithmetic, because the header is deliberately NOT
#                       trimmed while fragments ARE -- an asymmetry easy to get wrong arithmetically
#                       but trivially correct when the document is actually built and measured.
#   3. at_import     - `@`-prefixed path tokens inside the parent-chain files and the predicted
#                       generated CLAUDE.md, resolved relative to each CONTAINING FILE's OWN
#                       DIRECTORY (never the repo root, never .claude/ unconditionally) and
#                       existence-tested. A resolving ref contributes its bytes; a dangling ref is
#                       reported on its own line contributing 0 B (informational -- a future added-
#                       but-broken ref becomes visible instead of silently inert) and never fails
#                       --check by itself. Currently expected to report 0 resolving and 0 dangling
#                       refs: no `@`-ref exists anywhere in this chain today (context-layers.md
#                       channel 2 explains why merge sources deliberately use plain backticked
#                       paths instead) -- that is the CORRECT result, not evidence the channel is
#                       unexercised.
#   4. rules         - every source-store agent-system/extensions/*/rules/*.md file belonging to a
#                       CURRENTLY ACTIVE extension, classified by glob-MATCHING its `paths:`
#                       frontmatter against a representative touched-path set (see
#                       glob_to_ere()/EAGER_REP_PATHS below), never by hardcoding a rule-name list.
#
# THE CORRECTED `paths:` MODEL (deviation from a naive "absent or `**/*`" reading, recorded here
# per the plan's explicit instruction): checking only for absent-or-universal frontmatter
# undercounts eager rules by ~71%, because rules gated on `specs/**/*` / `.claude/**/*` (e.g.
# git-workflow.md, artifact-formats.md, state-management.md, error-handling.md, workflows.md) are
# ALSO effectively eager -- those globs match virtually any real session. See
# specs/archive/054_split_eager_rules_budget/baseline-bytes.md, section "Eager-Context
# Measurement-Harness Correction", for the full data behind this correction. This script instead
# glob-matches every rule's `paths:` value against EAGER_REP_PATHS (default
# "specs/**,.claude/**", overridable, echoed in every run's output so a reader can audit the
# classification rather than trust a hardcoded list). Consequence, stated plainly rather than
# reconciled away: this script's rule total EXCEEDS measure-eager-surface.sh's hardcoded six-rule
# figure by error-handling.md + workflows.md's combined bytes (both gated on `.claude/**/*` alone,
# which the historical six-rule baseline's `specs/**`-only representative set never caught). This
# is a correct, by-design divergence, not a bug to chase.
#
# VOLATILE-FILE GUARD: specs/TODO.md, specs/state.json, specs/errors.json (VOLATILE_PATHS array,
# extensible) must never be counted as legitimately eager. Every candidate path considered by any
# channel is checked against this deny-list; a hit emits a loud `FLAG:` line, excludes the file's
# bytes from the eager total, and makes --check exit 1. Today this class is empty in every channel
# (a forward-looking guard, not a fix for an observed violation).
#
# RELATIONSHIP TO measure-eager-surface.sh (both scripts COEXIST; neither supersedes the other):
# measure-eager-surface.sh remains the deployed-tree before/after delta tool with a FIXED
# nine-file/six-rule composition -- useful for apples-to-apples comparison across a single
# before/after cut. This script is the source-store PREDICTIVE harness with DYNAMIC `paths:`
# derivation, intended to answer "what would the eager set be if I redeployed right now" without
# ever requiring an actual redeploy. Its rule total is intentionally wider than
# measure-eager-surface.sh's historical six-rule figure (see the corrected-model paragraph above).
#
# Usage:
#   bash measure-eager-context.sh                 (--check, default) report only, exit 0/1
#   bash measure-eager-context.sh --check          same as above, explicit
#   bash measure-eager-context.sh --write [path]   report + write a timestamped JSON snapshot
#                                                   (default path under specs/ if omitted) for
#                                                   later drift comparison
#
# --check fails ONLY on a volatile-file hit or an unreadable required source -- never merely
# because the total changed from a prior run.
#
# STABLE OUTPUT CONTRACT: one tab-delimited record per contributing source, in the fixed field
# order CHANNEL / LABEL / PATH / BYTES / TOKENS_EST, preceded by a header line naming the fields.
# Per-channel SUBTOTAL rows and one grand TOTAL row (bytes + bytes/4 token estimate) follow. A
# FLAG line (volatile-file hit) and DANGLING lines (unresolved @-refs) use their own leading
# tokens and are never counted in any subtotal/total. This format is designed for `grep`/`cut` or
# `awk -F'\t'` consumption without depending on column alignment.
#
# --write's JSON snapshot models its CONTENT SHAPE on measure-eager-surface.sh's write_json()
# (timestamp, a flat sources array of {channel,label,path,bytes,tokens_est}, per-channel
# subtotals, total_bytes/total_tokens_est) while using THIS script's --check/--write flag
# vocabulary (matching generate-context-line-counts.sh's naming), not
# measure-eager-surface.sh's --baseline/--compare names. It additionally records the active
# representative touched-path set, so a later comparison can tell whether a delta came from
# content drift or from a changed measurement policy.
