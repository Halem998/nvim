# phase-heading-patterns.sh - Single source of truth for phase-heading parsing.
#
# This is the ONLY place the canonical `### Phase N: {name} [STATUS]` grammar, the closed
# status-marker enum, and non-conforming-heading detection are defined. It implements the policy
# documented in `context/formats/plan-format.md`'s "Canonical phase-heading shape" subsection --
# that document is the prose source of truth for the grammar; this file is its sole executable
# anchor. Every consumer sources this file rather than re-deriving an inline pattern; the current
# consumer list is found live via `grep -rl 'phase-heading-patterns.sh' agent-system/extensions`
# (the same self-verifying "grep for sourcers" mechanism `task-reference-patterns.sh`'s consumers
# are found by).
#
# Usage: `source` this file, then use the exported constants/arrays directly with `grep -E`
# (canonical forms) or plain `grep` (BRE compatibility aliases), and call `extract_phase_number`,
# `nonconforming_phase_headings`, and `warn_nonconforming` as documented below.
#
# Ordering contract for filtered scans: PHASE_HEADING_ERE filters to conforming headings only, so
# a non-conforming heading is not merely unmatched by a PHASE_HEADING_ERE-based grep -- it is
# INVISIBLE to it. A consumer that derives a SELECTION or a COUNT from such a filtered grep
# without checking the whole file first will silently select the next conforming candidate (or
# undercount) instead of surfacing the non-conforming heading. Therefore: any consumer that
# derives a selection or a count from a PHASE_HEADING_ERE-filtered grep MUST call
# `has_nonconforming_phase_headings <file>` over the WHOLE FILE FIRST, before the filtered scan,
# and take a named INCONCLUSIVE branch on a hit -- never merely a warning on the way to trusting
# the filtered result anyway. Use the boolean predicate `has_nonconforming_phase_headings`; the
# `nonconforming_phase_headings <file> | grep -q .` pipe form is FORBIDDEN (unsafe under
# `pipefail` -- see that function's own header comment for the race). The reference
# implementation of this ordering is `update-task-status.sh`'s phase-check (D3) gate: whole-file
# check first, named INCONCLUSIVE branch second, filtered count/selection trusted only in the
# else branch.

# ─── Canonical grammar (ERE) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The phase-number token is an integer with at most one optional decimal sub-level: `3`, `3.1`;
# never `3.1.2`, never `3a`. Letter-suffixed sub-phases are deliberately not supported -- see
# plan-format.md's "Canonical phase-heading shape" subsection for the D1 rationale. Copied
# verbatim from that section's canonical regex table, not re-derived.

# ERE heading match: the number token followed immediately by a colon. This is deliberately the
# gate `extract_phase_number` below runs BEFORE extracting anything -- a non-conforming token
# (`3a`, `3.1.2`, `III`) fails this match entirely rather than partially matching a prefix.
PHASE_HEADING_ERE='^### Phase [0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?:'

# ERE phase-number extraction: intended usage is `grep -oE "$PHASE_HEADING_ERE" | grep -oE
# '[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?'` -- but ONLY after the input line has already been confirmed to match
# PHASE_HEADING_ERE (see extract_phase_number). Applying the extraction grep alone, without the
# heading-match gate first, is exactly the `3a` -> `3` truncated-prefix collapse this library
# exists to eliminate -- never do that.
PHASE_NUMBER_EXTRACT_ERE="$PHASE_HEADING_ERE"

# Anchor prefix, exported separately so a consumer building a SPECIFIC-number lookup (e.g.
# `update-phase-status.sh`'s "find the heading for phase 3" rather than "find any phase heading")
# can compose `"${PHASE_HEADING_PREFIX}${validated_number}:"` instead of hand-typing the literal
# `### Phase ` string inline.
PHASE_HEADING_PREFIX='^### Phase '

# Bare number-TOKEN validator (no heading context) for validating a caller-supplied argument
# (e.g. a `phase_number` CLI argument) against the canonical grammar before using it to build a
# lookup pattern. Anchored on both ends: the whole argument must be exactly one conforming token,
# not merely contain one.
PHASE_NUMBER_TOKEN_ERE='^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$'

# BRE (`grep`, no `-E`) compatibility alias. Required-equivalent to PHASE_HEADING_ERE on every
# fixture in scripts/tests/test-phase-heading-patterns.sh -- a divergence between the two is
# exactly the drift this library exists to prevent (see that test's "Equivalence fixtures").
PHASE_HEADING_BRE='^### Phase [0-9][0-9]*\(\.[0-9][0-9]*\)\{0,1\}:'

# Loose "claims to be a phase heading" ERE: anchored on `^### Phase ` only, matching any token and
# any bracket content. This is what makes non-conformance detectable instead of invisible -- a
# line that matches this loose form but fails PHASE_HEADING_ERE or the marker enum below is a
# non-conforming phase heading, not a non-heading line to be silently skipped.
PHASE_HEADING_LOOSE_ERE='^### Phase '

# The marker-shape character class used by the historical TOTAL count: uppercase letters and
# spaces only, satisfied by every real enum value including `COMPLETED WITH EXCLUSIONS`. Matching
# this class is necessary but NOT sufficient for conformance -- `[DESCOPED]` and `[FOOBAR]` both
# satisfy it; the enum check in nonconforming_phase_headings below is what actually validates the
# marker text.
PHASE_MARKER_CLASS_ERE='\[[A-Z][A-Z ]*\][[:space:]]*$'

# Convenience full-line forms mirroring the pre-existing TOTAL/DONE regexes verbatim (a conforming
# heading, i.e. PHASE_HEADING_ERE, followed anywhere by a marker of the matched shape). These
# match a "looks-conforming" heading; they do NOT themselves reject a marker outside the enum
# (e.g. `[DESCOPED]` still matches PHASE_HEADING_TOTAL_ERE) -- pair them with
# nonconforming_phase_headings for the enum-level check.
