# continuation-pointer-lib.sh — Shared continuation-pointer resolution for /orchestrate.
#
# Purpose: a continuation pointer may arrive on a handoff as either the deprecated nested
# continuation_context.handoff_path (no live writer emits this today) or the flat top-level
# continuation_path (the one canonical form live H9 hard-mode wrap-up writers emit). Before this
# library, this exact jq expression was hand-copied at multiple sites -- SKILL.md's `partial`
# handler (single-task Stage 4/5) and its MT-4 `implement_tasks` loop, plus
# orchestrate-triage-classify.sh's own `continuation_ok` predicate -- with a documented history of
# one copy drifting from the others (see that script's header comment: "do not let this
# hand-applied copy drift from that script again"). This is now the SINGLE canonical
# implementation; do not hand-copy the jq expression a third time.
#
# Class C (sourced only; sets no shell options of its own -- per shell-strict-mode.md, a sourced
# library must never change the calling shell's error-handling behavior; never invoked directly
# as `bash continuation-pointer-lib.sh`).
#
# Usage (after sourcing):
#   result=$(resolve_continuation_pointer "<handoff_path>")
#
# Echoes, on stdout, one compact-JSON line:
#   {"handoff_path": "<path>", "orchestrator_mode": true}   -- a pointer was found, either form,
#                                                                normalized to this one shape
#   null                                                     -- neither form present, or the
#                                                                handoff file is missing/unparseable
#
# Callers needing only a boolean (e.g. orchestrate-triage-classify.sh's continuation_ok) test the
# function's own output for the literal string "null":
#   result=$(resolve_continuation_pointer "$handoff_path")
#   if [ "$result" = "null" ]; then continuation_ok="false"; else continuation_ok="true"; fi
