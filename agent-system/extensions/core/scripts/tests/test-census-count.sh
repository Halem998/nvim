# test-census-count.sh - Fixture-driven regression suite for census-count.sh, proving the
# shipped tool actually catches the three named repo-wide-count bug classes rather than merely
# handling happy-path input.
#
# Anti-vacuous-test guard: every bug-class group below asserts BOTH a naive/wrong number AND the
# tool's correct number on the SAME fixture, so a fixture that both approaches would get right
# never counts as coverage (per context/standards/shell-script-testing.md's mutation-check
# discipline, applied here to census-count.sh itself rather than to a regex fix).
#
# Follows the core shell-test convention: pass()/fail()/info() helpers, PASSED/FAILED integer
# counters, mktemp -d workdir with a trap EXIT cleanup, exit 0 on all-pass and exit 1 on any-fail.
# All fixtures are synthetic, built inline via heredocs into the temp root -- this suite never
# reads or asserts against the real repository tree.
#
# Exit codes: 0 -- all cases PASS; 1 -- at least one case FAILED.
