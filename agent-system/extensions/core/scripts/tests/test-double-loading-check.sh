# test-double-loading-check.sh - Fixture-driven regression suite for the Double-Loading Check
# section of validate-context-budgets.sh: the mechanical three-bucket redundancy predicate
# (redundant / legitimate-dual / unclassifiable-command) that replaced the prior shape-only
# "both agents[] and commands[] hooks present" WARNING.
#
# Drives the DEPLOYED script as a real subprocess (`.claude/scripts/validate-context-budgets.sh
# --index <fixture>`), never the source-store copy: deploy-root-guard.sh hard-exits when a
# script's own SCRIPT_DIR is not under a `.claude`/`.opencode` deploy tree, so the source-store
# sibling cannot be executed directly. Route derivation inside the script still reads the real
# deployed manifest.json / skill SKILL.md files (via REPO_ROOT, auto-derived from the deployed
# script's own location) for every case except the degraded-derivation case below, which
# overrides one route source via an env var the script exposes specifically for this purpose
# (VALIDATE_BUDGETS_MANIFEST_OVERRIDE) rather than mutating the real deployed manifest.json.
#
# Five cases, matching the plan's Scope Hypothesis for this phase:
#   1. Positive     - the check still fires on the most common redundant shape.
#   2. Discrimination - a direct command does not trip the check (proves it isn't trivially firing).
#   3. Orchestrate  - /orchestrate's union reach never subsumes an entry's agents[].
#   4. Unclassifiable - an unroutable (e.g. extension) command lands in its own named bucket,
#                        not silently folded into "legitimate", and does not affect the exit code.
#   5. Degraded route derivation - an unreadable route source produces the loud
#      [DEGRADED ROUTE DERIVATION] banner and treats the affected command as unclassifiable,
#      never as direct and never as a silent no-op.
#
# Inversion check (this suite's own self-test, run last): temporarily inverts the redundancy
# predicate's sense (NOT instead of the true subset test) via a scratch-patched copy of the
# deployed script and re-runs cases 1 and 2, asserting they now FAIL -- proving the two positive
# assertions above are live and not vacuously true. This never touches the real deployed script;
# it operates on a throwaway copy in the test's own workdir.
#
# Structural model: test-index-entries-schema.sh / test-validate-no-task-references.sh
# (pass()/fail()/info() helpers, PASSED/FAILED integer counters, mktemp -d workdir with a trap
# EXIT cleanup, exit 0 on all-pass and exit 1 on any-fail).
#
# Exit codes: 0 -- all assertions PASS; 1 -- at least one assertion FAILED; 2 -- environment
# error (deployed script not found -- this suite categorically cannot run against the
# source-store copy, see deploy-root-guard.sh above).
