# test-lint-branch-gated-sections.sh - Fixture-driven regression test for
# scripts/lint/lint-branch-gated-sections.sh.
#
# Pins the lint's behaviour against synthetic fixtures only; this suite never depends on the
# live tree being clean (that is a separate, whole-tree assertion covered by verify-deploy.sh
# gate 19) and never mutates the repository.
#
# Structural model: test-lint-task-lookup-adoption.sh (mktemp -d workdir, deploy-tree-first /
# source-store-fallback candidate resolution, pass()/fail()/info() helpers).
#
# Exit codes: 0 -- all cases PASS; 1 -- at least one case FAILED; 2 -- environment error.
# Note this is a test OF a lint: its exit code reports test success, not lint success.
