# test-index-entries-schema.sh - Fixture-driven regression suite for check-extension-docs.sh's
# Rule T (check_index_entries_schema) and Rule U (check_extension_md_length).
#
# Structural model: test-validate-no-task-references.sh (pass()/fail()/info() helpers,
# PASSED/FAILED integer counters, mktemp -d workdir with a trap EXIT cleanup, exit 0 on all-pass
# and exit 1 on any-fail). Unlike that suite, this one drives check-extension-docs.sh as a real
# subprocess against a single synthetic fixture extension (EXT_DIR pointed at a tree containing
# ONLY the fixture), rather than sourcing a library directly -- Rule T/U are check-extension-
# docs.sh's own per-extension checks, not standalone library functions.
#
# check-extension-docs.sh resolution DELIBERATELY prefers the SOURCE-STORE sibling copy over
# a deployed .claude/scripts/ copy -- the opposite priority from the deploy-tree-first /
# source-store-fallback pattern other tests in this directory use for stable, rarely-edited
# libraries. This suite exists specifically to validate Rule T/U as they are developed in the
# source store; a deployed copy is regenerated only by a later, separate deploy step, so
# preferring it here would silently test stale logic (confirmed empirically: preferring deploy
# first here made every assertion fail against a source-store change not yet redeployed). REPO_ROOT
# is always passed explicitly to the script under test (the sanctioned override -- see
# check-extension-docs.sh's own REPO_ROOT auto-detect comment), never left to auto-detect, since
# this test is expected to run directly from the source store per this task's own Risk table.
#
# Exit codes: 0 -- all assertions PASS; 1 -- at least one assertion FAILED; 2 -- environment
# error (script under test not found at any candidate path).
