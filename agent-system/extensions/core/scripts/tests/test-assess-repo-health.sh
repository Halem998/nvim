# test-assess-repo-health.sh - Fixture-driven regression suite for assess-repo-health.sh, proving
# the probe fails in its failing direction using executed tests -- the exact property the
# original markdown-embedded probe (`if cmd_a || cmd_b || true; then ... fi`) lacked, since that
# shape made its failure branch structurally unreachable and no test could have caught it.
#
# Cases:
#   Clean fixture (control) -- a valid *.sh and *.json. Asserts build_errors == 0 and
#     status == "healthy". Without this control, Bar 1 below could pass from a probe that always
#     reports failure regardless of input.
#   Bar 1 (failing fixture) -- a *.sh with a deliberate syntax error (unmatched quote) and a
#     malformed *.json. Asserts build_errors > 0, status != "healthy", and status is a member of
#     the schema's declared enum.
#   Bar 2 (no-probe fixture) -- only unrecognised file types (.txt, .lua). Asserts build_errors is
#     JSON null -- explicitly asserted to be neither 0 nor 1 -- and status == "unknown".
#   Enum-conformance -- every status value observed across the cases above is checked against
#     context/schemas/state-schema.json's `repository_health.status.enum`, read live via jq (an
#     anti-drift check modelled on test-status-vocabulary.sh).
#   Bar 3 (frontmatter idempotence, regression lock) -- generate-todo.sh, run twice against a
#     fixed synthetic state.json, must leave TODO.md's YAML frontmatter region byte-identical.
#     generate-todo.sh is unmodified by this task; this locks in the pre-existing full-overwrite
#     behavior the plan's Phase 4 rationale depends on. Requires a deployed
#     .claude/scripts/generate-todo.sh (its own deploy-root-guard.sh refuses the source-store
#     copy) -- SKIPPED with a named [INFO] line, not counted as FAILED, when absent.
#   Bar 4 (phantom-only, git fixture) -- a THIRD fixture kind: a real git work tree (git
#     init/add/commit), unlike every case above. One tracked *.sh stays in place (so
#     total_candidates remains nonzero) and a second tracked *.sh is `mv`'d without staging.
#     Asserts build_errors == 0, status == "healthy", and phantom_paths == 1 -- a
#     moved-but-unstaged tracked file must contribute nothing to build_errors.
#   Bar 5 (phantom plus real defect, git fixture) -- same shape as Bar 4, but the file left in
#     place carries a deliberate syntax error instead of being valid. Asserts build_errors == 1
#     exactly (explicitly neither 0 nor 2), status == "critical", and phantom_paths == 1 -- a
#     real defect is still counted despite a phantom entry also being present.
#   Bar 6 (all-phantom degenerate, git fixture) -- the fixture's only tracked structural
#     candidate is moved away unstaged, leaving zero real candidates. Asserts build_errors is
#     JSON null (explicitly neither 0 nor 1), status == "unknown", and phantom_paths == 1 --
#     proving phantom paths are excluded from total_candidates itself, not merely from the error
#     count.
#
# Non-git-fixture note: every fixture in Bars 1-3 and the clean control is built under a
# `mktemp -d` workdir, which is never a git work tree. Those cases therefore exercise
# assess-repo-health.sh's `find`-based enumeration fallback, not its `git ls-files` path -- all
# passing IS the proof that fallback works, not an incidental detail. See the info() line emitted
# at suite start. Bars 4-6 are the complementary git-work-tree fixture kind, added to exercise the
# `git ls-files` path specifically -- see the info() line emitted just before them, and SKIPPED
# with a named [INFO] line (not counted as FAILED) when `git` is unavailable on PATH.
#
# Negative-control demonstration (manual, not automated in this file -- see
# context/standards/shell-script-testing.md's "Mutation checks for regex-shaped fixes"): before
# trusting this suite, its cases were confirmed to go [FAIL] when assess-repo-health.sh's failure
# counter was deliberately inverted (`errors=$(( ...==0 ? 1 : 0 ))`-style flip), then reverted.
# See the phase's implementation summary for the transcript of that run.
#
# Structural model: scripts/tests/test-status-vocabulary.sh (pass()/fail()/info() helpers,
# PASSED/FAILED integer counters, deploy-tree-first/source-store-fallback resolution for both the
# script under test and the schema, exit 0 on all-pass / exit 1 on any-fail).
#
# Exit codes: 0 -- all cases PASS; 1 -- at least one case FAILED; 2 -- environment error
# (assess-repo-health.sh or state-schema.json not found at any candidate path, or jq unavailable).
