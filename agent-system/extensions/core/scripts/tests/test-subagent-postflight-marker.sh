# test-subagent-postflight-marker.sh - Fixture-driven regression suite for the
# malformed-postflight-marker fix: subagent-postflight.sh's diagnosable block reason and
# events-log-lifecycle.sh's deviation-event telemetry, both guarded by `jq empty` against a
# marker that fails to parse as JSON.
#
# Structural model: test-guard-destructive-git.sh's SCRIPT_DIR-relative hook path (resolves in
# both source-store and deployed layouts with no branching), pass()/fail()/info() helpers,
# PASSED/FAILED counters, mktemp -d fixtures with trap cleanup EXIT, exit 0 all-pass / 1 any-fail.
#
# subagent-postflight.sh has no dependency on its own script-path depth (it locates markers via
# `find specs ...` against cwd), so its cases run the source-store or deployed hook directly, in
# place, as a real subprocess -- exactly like test-guard-destructive-git.sh does.
#
# events-log-lifecycle.sh is different: events-append.sh (which it shells out to) resolves its
# write target via `deploy-root-guard.sh` + a script-path-depth calculation that (a) REFUSES to
# run at all from a source-store path (deploy-root-guard.sh requires the immediate parent
# directory to be named `.claude` or `.opencode`) and (b) even when deployed, always resolves to
# THIS repo's real specs/events.jsonl regardless of the subprocess's cwd -- there is no way to
# redirect it via cwd alone. Driving it in place would therefore either hard-fail outside a
# deployed tree, or (if deployed) silently append test rows into the real events store. The
# events companion case instead builds an ISOLATED copy of the four files it needs
# (events-log-lifecycle.sh, events-append.sh, deploy-root-guard.sh, lib/common.sh) under a fresh
# mktemp -d tree shaped as <tmp>/.claude/{hooks,scripts,scripts/lib}/ with <tmp>/specs/ as a
# sibling -- satisfying deploy-root-guard.sh's parent-name check while anchoring
# events-append.sh's root resolution entirely inside the disposable fixture, never touching the
# real repo's specs/events.jsonl.
#
# Exit codes: 0 -- all cases PASS; 1 -- at least one case FAILED.
