# roadmap-integration.sh - Parse ROADMAP.md, cross-reference with state, annotate completed items
#
# Implements Steps 2.5-2.5.3 from /review command:
#   2.5   Parse ROADMAP.md
#   2.5.2 Cross-reference roadmap with project state
#   2.5.3 Annotate completed roadmap items
#
# Usage:
#   bash roadmap-integration.sh --roadmap specs/ROADMAP.md --state specs/state.json
#   bash roadmap-integration.sh --roadmap specs/ROADMAP.md --state specs/state.json --annotate
#
# Options:
#   --roadmap PATH    Path to ROADMAP.md (required)
#   --state PATH      Path to state.json (required)
#   --annotate        Apply high-confidence annotations to ROADMAP.md (default: parse only)
#   --dry-run         Show what annotations would be made without applying them
#
# Output:
#   JSON object with roadmap_state, roadmap_matches, annotation_summary, roadmap_structure, and
#   warnings to stdout. If --annotate: also applies edits to ROADMAP.md and prints annotation
#   summary to stderr.
#
#   Every invocation, in every mode (including parse-only), also prints an always-present
#   machine-readable marker to stderr:
#     <!-- roadmap-structure phases=N checkboxes=M table_rows=T parseable=true|false -->
#   and, when warranted, one or both loud banners:
#     [UNPARSEABLE ROADMAP - 0 phases, 0 checkboxes, 0 table rows] ...
#     [ROADMAP ANNOTATION NO-OP - {K} high-confidence match(es), 0 applied] Skip reasons: ...
#   These never affect the exit code -- they are diagnostics, not failures.
#
# status_tables[] / table-sourced roadmap_matches[] entries additionally carry line_index
# (0-based), raw_line (unmodified source text), and status_index (the column the completion
# allowlist matched), which the table-row annotation path uses to locate and safely rewrite a row
# in place. Checkbox-sourced match objects never carry these keys.
#
# Caller contract:
#   (a) Parse-only mode (omitting --annotate) is a supported, first-class call shape. Its purpose
#       is to obtain roadmap_structure/warnings/roadmap_matches without mutating ROADMAP.md at
#       all -- a caller that only needs the structure signal or the match list, not an applied
#       edit, should call the script this way rather than treating --annotate as the only mode.
#   (b) The archive input is resolved as the sibling ${STATE_PATH%state.json}archive/state.json.
#       A caller that passes a synthesized or filtered --state snapshot living outside specs/
#       therefore gets an empty archive set (the sibling path will not exist) -- this is the
#       supported way to scope a run to a caller-chosen task subset, not an accident to work
#       around. A caller relying on this must place its snapshot outside specs/ deliberately.
#   (c) The script applies no task_type filter and has no abandoned-status branch: its
#       COMPLETED_TASKS/ARCHIVED_TASKS queries only ever select status == "completed", and its
#       only annotation-suffix construction is the "*(Completed: Task N ...)*" format. A caller
#       needing to exclude a task type (e.g. meta tasks) or to annotate an abandoned-task branch
#       must filter its own --state input, or implement that annotation path itself -- neither is
#       something a future change to this script should add, since doing so would widen an
#       already-fixed, already-verified call site for the benefit of a caller that can filter its
#       own input instead.
