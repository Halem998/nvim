# --- Tier derivation -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tier is DERIVED from load_when shape, never read from an authored `tier` field. The entry
# schema (context/index.schema.json) deliberately omits `tier` and records in its $comment that
# the value "is meant to be derived algorithmically from load_when shape rather than
# hand-authored, since no entry in practice ever populated it accurately" -- and, with
# `additionalProperties: false` on the entry shape, an authored `tier` is not even schema-legal.
# This function is the single definition of that derivation; it is prepended to every jq program
# below that needs a tier, so there is exactly one rule table in this file.
#
#   Rule table (first match wins, total over all entries):
#     load_when.always == true                        -> Tier 1  (always loaded)
#     load_when.agents non-empty                      -> Tier 2  (agent-scoped)
#     load_when.commands or task_types non-empty      -> Tier 3  (command/task-type-scoped)
#     every hook empty                                -> Tier 4  (on-demand / grep-only)
#
# Because case 4 is a fallthrough on emptiness, "all hooks empty" now DERIVES to Tier 4 rather
# than being an authored claim. That is what makes the old Dead Entry Check ("not Tier 4 but
# never loaded") a tautology, and why that check is keyed on the explicit `on_demand` marker
# instead -- see the Dead Entry Check section below.
#
# See context/standards/context-tier-semantics.md for the full explanation and rationale behind
# this rule table and the on_demand decision rule; this comment states the rule, that file
# explains and motivates it.
