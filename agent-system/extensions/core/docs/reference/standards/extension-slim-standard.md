# EXTENSION.md Slim-Down Standard

## Purpose

EXTENSION.md files are injected into CLAUDE.md context when loaded via the extension picker. Large EXTENSION.md files waste context window budget on documentation that agents rarely need during routing. This standard defines maximum size and required content for EXTENSION.md files, and (see "Shape-(a) Merge Sources" below) extends the same discipline to shape-(a) `merge-sources/claudemd.md` sources.

## Size Limit

**Maximum: 60 lines** for any EXTENSION.md file. Lint-enforced: `check-extension-docs.sh`'s
Rule U flags any EXTENSION.md exceeding 60 lines (severity controlled by
`SCHEMA_CONFORMANCE_GATE_MODE`, defaulting `hard`) -- run the lint for the current violator
count rather than trusting a hand-maintained total, which goes stale as extensions are added.

## Resource-Only / Non-EXTENSION.md-Source Extensions

This standard applies only to an extension whose manifest names `EXTENSION.md` as its
`merge_targets.claudemd.source` -- the file `generate_claudemd()` actually reads when composing
`.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Both the required-file check and Rule U in `check-extension-docs.sh` are
manifest-authoritative on this field (see that script's `claudemd_source_for` helper and its
rationale comment), not a hardcoded "every extension must have EXTENSION.md" assumption. Two
cases fall outside this standard's scope entirely:

- **A different claudemd source**: `core` points `merge_targets.claudemd.source` at
  `merge-sources/claudemd.md` instead of `EXTENSION.md`, and has no `EXTENSION.md` file at all.
  This 60-line, LINE-count limit does not apply to that shape-(a) source -- but a separate
  BYTE-count ceiling does; see "Shape-(a) Merge Sources" below.
- **No claudemd source (resource-only extensions)**: an extension with zero
  `provides.skills`/`provides.commands` that shares only context (e.g. `slidev`) may omit
  `merge_targets.claudemd` entirely, per `creating-extensions.md`'s "Resource-Only Extensions"
  section. `check-extension-docs.sh` emits an advisory (never a silent skip) if a NON-resource-only
  extension (non-empty `provides.skills` or `provides.commands`) omits `merge_targets.claudemd`,
  distinguishing an accidental omission from this intentional pattern.

Both `core/EXTENSION.md` and `slidev/EXTENSION.md` were deleted (not trimmed) because each was a
100% content subset of its own `README.md` and neither was reachable from `generate_claudemd()`'s
actual merge path.

## Shape-(a) Merge Sources

A shape-(a) source (`merge_targets.claudemd.source` naming something other than `EXTENSION.md`,
e.g. `merge-sources/claudemd.md`) has no natural line-count analog to Rule U's 60-line limit --
these files carry real, structured CLAUDE.md content (Task Management, Command Reference, and
similar sections), not a slim routing summary. Instead, each shape-(a) source is held to an
explicit **byte ceiling**, declared per-extension in
`context/config/claudemd-size-budget.json` and enforced by `check-extension-docs.sh`'s Rule V
(same `SCHEMA_CONFORMANCE_GATE_MODE` severity as Rule U). Today exactly two extensions are
shape-(a): `core` and `literature`; re-derive the shape-(a) set live via
`jq -r '.merge_targets.claudemd.source' agent-system/extensions/*/manifest.json` rather than
trusting this count, which goes stale as extensions are added.

Each named ceiling in the budget config is derived from that extension's own measured post-cut
size (round up to the next 500 B, then add ~5% headroom), recorded alongside the ceiling with a
`derivation` comment field. A `default_ceiling_bytes` value covers any future shape-(a)
extension with no named entry yet.

**Why an external config file, not a `manifest.json` field**: a manifest-schema task is in
flight at the time this ceiling was introduced, so the ceiling deliberately lands as an external
config rather than a new `merge_targets.claudemd.max_bytes` manifest field. Promoting it to a
manifest field once that schema work lands is a natural follow-up, not a rejected design.
`check-extension-docs.sh` reads the config from the SOURCE STORE
(`agent-system/extensions/core/context/config/claudemd-size-budget.json`, resolved via its own
`EXT_DIR`), so no deploy of the config file is required for Rule V to see current ceilings --
declaring the `config` directory in `core/manifest.json`'s `provides.context` is a
discoverability nicety, not a functional dependency for this rule.

## Required Sections

EXTENSION.md must contain only these four sections:

| Section | Lines | Content |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Header** | 3-5 | Extension name, version, one-line description |
| **Routing Table** | 5-15 | Skill-to-agent mappings (primary purpose of EXTENSION.md) |
| **Command List** | 5-15 | Command name, usage, one-line description per row |
| **Context Pointers** | 3-5 | Lazy @-references to context files (max 5 pointers) |

See the Migration Template below for a concrete example of all four sections.

## Sections That Must Move to Context Files

The following content types do NOT belong in EXTENSION.md:

| Content Type | Move To | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Detailed usage examples | `context/project/{ext}/patterns/` | Command workflows, input/output examples |
| Architecture documentation | `context/project/{ext}/domain/` | System design, component relationships |
| Conversion/compatibility tables | `context/project/{ext}/domain/` | Format support matrices with fallbacks |
| Migration guides | `context/project/{ext}/domain/` | Version upgrade instructions |
| Troubleshooting | `context/project/{ext}/domain/` | Error resolution, debugging tips |
| Prerequisites/installation | `context/project/{ext}/tools/` | Dependency lists, platform setup |
| MCP tool integration | `context/project/{ext}/tools/` | Server config, API keys |
| Forcing data schemas | `context/project/{ext}/patterns/` | JSON structures, data formats |
| Mode descriptions | `context/project/{ext}/domain/` | Operational mode details |

## Context File Location

New context files go in the extension's existing context directory structure:

```
.claude/extensions/{ext}/
  context/project/{ext}/
    domain/       # Domain knowledge, reference tables
    patterns/     # Workflow patterns, usage examples
    tools/        # Tool setup, dependencies
    templates/    # Output templates
```

## Index Integration

Every new context file must have an entry in the extension's `index-entries.json`:

```json
{
  "path": "project/{ext}/domain/conversion-tables.md",
  "domain": "project",
  "subdomain": "{ext}",
  "summary": "Format conversion support matrix with fallback chains",
  "line_count": 45,
  "load_when": {
    "agents": ["relevant-agent"],
    "task_types": ["{ext}"]
  }
}
```

The authoritative field definition lives in
`agent-system/extensions/core/context/index.schema.json` -- if this example and that schema ever
disagree, the schema wins; fix this example rather than treating it as a second authority.
