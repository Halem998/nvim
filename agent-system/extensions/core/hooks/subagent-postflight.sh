# SubagentStop hook to prevent premature workflow termination
# Called when a subagent session is about to stop
#
# Purpose: Force continuation when postflight operations are pending
# This prevents the "continue" prompt issue between skill return and orchestrator postflight
#
# Returns:
#   {"decision": "block", "reason": "..."} - Prevents stop, forces continuation
#   {} - Allows normal stop
#
# Marker selection is correlated to the stopping Claude Code session via each marker's
# `cc_session_id` field (written by skill_create_postflight_marker in scripts/skill-base.sh,
# sourced from $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID) against hook stdin's top-level `.session_id`. With
# markers from several concurrent sessions on disk, an uncorrelated `head -1` pick could block
# the wrong session, increment a foreign task's loop guard, or delete a marker it does not own.
# Fail-safe: on no match, act on NO marker -- never fall back to an arbitrary one. This applies
# equally to legacy markers (written before `cc_session_id` existed) and to a marker whose
# `cc_session_id` is present but empty. Mirrored in events-log-lifecycle.sh's SubagentStop
# branch, which applies the identical correlation to its own separate `MARKER_FILE` selection.
#
# Known, accepted limitation: within a single Claude Code session holding two markers
# simultaneously, `cc_session_id` does not disambiguate which of that session's own markers
# belongs to the subagent that just stopped. Hook stdin carries no Task-tool-call-scoped
# identifier that would let the writer disambiguate in advance; this is out of scope here.

# Read hook stdin (this hook previously read no stdin at all). `read -t 0.1` bounds the read so
# an absent or terminal stdin can never block the hook -- mirrors events-log-lifecycle.sh's
# identical drain idiom. Defaults to `{}` when stdin is empty or absent.
