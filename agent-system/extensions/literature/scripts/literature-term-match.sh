#!/usr/bin/env bash
# literature-term-match.sh - Shared Tier 1 keyword-matching helper (source-only)
#
# Usage (sourced, never executed directly):
#   source "$SCRIPT_DIR/literature-term-match.sh"
#   mapfile -t FILTERED_TERMS < <(filter_terms "$SEARCH_TERMS")
#   term_matches "$haystack" "$needle"
#
# Call sites:
#   - literature-discover.sh (Tier 1: global LITERATURE_DIR/index.json title/keyword search)
#   - literature-coverage-delta.sh (topic-scoped coverage-delta guard, keyword pass)
#
# Contract (not an implementation detail -- both call sites depend on this exact behavior):
#   - to_lower(): case-fold a string for case-insensitive comparison.
#   - term_matches(haystack, needle): case-insensitive substring match, true/false via exit code.
#   - STOP_WORDS: space-separated short-word list filter_terms() strips, alongside any term
#     under 3 characters.
#   - filter_terms(input): splits input on whitespace, lowercases, drops stop words and terms
#     under 3 characters, prints one filtered term per line.
#   - MULTI_TERM_MATCH_THRESHOLD (5): the match-strength trigger. A caller's own matching loop
#     (this file does not implement one) must apply "accept-on-first-hit" when the filtered term
#     count is at or below this threshold, and require >= 2 distinct term hits when it exceeds
#     the threshold. This asymmetric behavior is deliberate (short, hand-typed queries are not
#     penalized; long, capped task descriptions are) and is the caller's responsibility to
#     preserve, not this file's -- it only supplies the pieces.
#
# Implementation note (fork-free): to_lower() and term_matches() are pure-bash (`${var,,}` /
# `[[ == *needle* ]]`), not `echo | tr` / `echo | grep -qF` pipelines -- fork/exec was measured as
# the dominant cost of the callers' keyword-matching loops. The external contract above (case-
# insensitive substring match, true/false via exit code) is unchanged. Two narrow behavioral
# deltas versus the old pipe-based implementation are known and accepted, not defects:
#   - `${var,,}` is locale-aware and case-folds non-ASCII uppercase (e.g. Greek `Π` -> `π`) where
#     `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'` operates bytewise and never touches non-ASCII. This can only
#     ever ADD a match relative to the old behavior, never remove one. See the implementation
#     summary for the task that introduced this change for the full-corpus divergence audit.
#   - `${1,,}` neither strips a trailing newline from its argument (the old `$(echo "$1" | tr ...)`
#     did, via command substitution) nor treats a leading `-n`/`-e` argument as an `echo` option
#     (the old implementation could swallow one). Both call sites only ever pass single-line,
#     already-tokenized terms/titles/keywords, so neither delta is reachable in practice today.
#
# This file has no `set -e` and is guarded against double-sourcing (BASH_SOURCE-keyed guard
# variable) since a sourced helper must never alter the sourcing script's shell options or be
# re-defined redundantly when sourced from more than one call path in the same process.
