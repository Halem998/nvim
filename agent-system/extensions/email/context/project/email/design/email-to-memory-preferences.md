# Design: Email-to-Memory Preference Contribution

**Task**: 821 (design) -> 822 (implementation, queued, depends on 821)
**Status**: Design complete. No production code in this document; `email-preferences.md`'s
static classifier rule table is untouched by this design.
**Research input**: `specs/821_email_to_memory_contribution_architecture/reports/01_team-research.md`
(4-teammate team research; skeleton converged, 8 gaps identified: G1-G8)

## Purpose

Route **confirmed** `skill-email-cleanup` decisions (junk vs keep) into the memory vault as
**sender/domain-aggregated preference memories** that evolve over time (CREATE once, then
UPDATE/EXTEND) — never one memory per message. This document resolves the eight load-bearing
gaps (G1-G8) the research phase identified in the convergent skeleton, verifies the identity key
against real mail, and hands 822 an explicit scope recommendation.

### Convergent Skeleton (from research, unchanged)

- **Capture point**: an opt-in harvest step inside `skill-email-cleanup`, firing after Stage 6
  (Verify), on verified confirmed actions only.
- **Aggregation unit**: the sender/domain identity (Phase 2 below), keyed off the `--all` mode
  Stage 2.5 bucket in bulk sweeps, or the approved manifest's `sender` field in default mode.
- **Storage**: vault memories via `skill-memory` CREATE/UPDATE/EXTEND, under a reserved topic
  namespace `email/preferences/{key}`.
- **Gate**: reuse `skill-todo`'s harvest -> dedup -> tiered `AskUserQuestion` -> batch-regen
  *logic* (not its `state.json` substrate), one consolidated non-silent prompt.

---

## 1. Capture Point, Harvest Trigger, and Evidentiary Rules (G1, C1, C2)

### 1.1 Capture point (cites `skill-email-cleanup/SKILL.md`)

The harvest fires **after Stage 6 (Verify)**, never earlier:

- **Default mode**, Stage 6 (`SKILL.md:178-181`): "Diff the wrapper's own execution-state output
  (never re-derived) against the approved manifest to confirm which IDs were actually mutated."
  The harvest reads exactly this diff's *executed* set — not the Stage 2 candidate manifest
  (`proposed_action`, unconfirmed) and not the Stage 3/4 approved-but-not-yet-executed manifest
  (which can still fail at Stage 5 Execute or be skipped by a wrapper-level refusal).
- **`--all` mode**, Stage 6 (`SKILL.md:398-402`): "diff the per-split execution-state files
  (never re-derived) against the approved manifest across ALL splits and report totals —
  executed, failed ..., skipped ..., and expired-unexecuted residual." The harvest reads only
  the *executed* totals; failed/skipped/expired IDs contribute no evidence.

Only a Message-ID that the wrapper itself confirms as `executed` (via its own state-file diff,
per wrapper-contracts.md §4) is preference-worthy evidence. This is deliberate: it makes the
harvest immune to approval-without-execution (expired manifest, wrapper refusal, individual ID
failure) — an approved-but-unexecuted action asserts nothing about what actually happened to the
message.

### 1.2 Harvest unit

- **`--all` mode**: the Stage 2.5 bucket grouping (`bulk-bucket-review.md`: domain key,
  full-address for freemail/shared domains, `min()` confidence rollup) is the harvest
  *trigger/start key* — one candidate per bucket touched, cross-referenced against the Stage 6
  executed diff so only actually-executed members of the bucket count as evidence.
- **Default mode**: no bucket exists (50-cap linear flow), so the key is derived post-hoc,
  per executed Message-ID, from the approved manifest's `sender` field (normalized per Phase 2),
  then grouped by the Phase 2 key across all executed IDs in that Stage 6 pass.
- Never one candidate per message — the memory-write decision always operates on the
  post-normalization group, never a single raw manifest line.

### 1.3 Rejected alternatives (recorded with rationale)

- **`hooks: {}` lifecycle slot**: verified `.claude/extensions/memory/manifest.json` declares
  `"hooks": {}` (schema-ready, empty) and `.claude/extensions/email/manifest.json` has no
  `hooks` key at all (absent, not even declared empty) — neither extension has ever exercised
  this slot; its failure-isolation contract is unproven in this repo. Rejected as a starting
  dependency for a design meant to ship soon; revisit only if a second hook consumer emerges.
- **Deferred `/todo`-substrate harvest**: `.claude/scripts/memory-harvest.sh` reads
  `.active_projects[] | select(.project_number == $task) | .memory_candidates` from
  `specs/state.json` (verified by reading the script) — it is keyed on `project_number`.
  `/email` is direct-execution with no task directory and no `project_number`; this substrate
  literally does not exist for it. Rejected, not merely deprioritized.

### 1.4 Evidentiary threshold (G1/C1)

A running **per-action tally** (Phase 3's `{delete_count, archive_count, keep_count,
last_seen}`) is read back on every harvest pass. A memory is CREATEd or its dominant action
STRENGTHENED only when either:

- **Uniform action across the batch/bucket** for that identity key in this Stage-6 pass (the
  common case in `--all` mode: a bucket approved-and-executed as one action satisfies this
  trivially), OR
- **Rolling N>=3 confirms at >=80% consistency**: across this pass's tally update, the
  post-update dominant action's count is >=3 and represents >=80% of that key's total confirmed
  count. This is evaluated **after** applying this pass's increments to the stored tally, so a
  single default-mode confirm can cross the threshold on, say, its 3rd/4th visit — the harvest
  step is therefore stateful and must read the existing memory (if any) before deciding whether
  to write.

A single isolated confirm below both bars is *recorded* (the tally increments — see Phase 4
EXTEND path) but does not on its own justify presenting the sender as a strong preference in any
future gate/read-back surfacing; it simply accumulates toward the threshold.

### 1.5 Mixed-sender handling (C2)

First-class branch, not an edge case: when a would-be identity key's confirmed actions in this
pass are heterogeneous with no uniform majority (the canonical example: a `github.com` bucket
where security-alert subjects are kept and marketing-digest subjects are junked), the harvest
either:

- **Splits** by a subject/category token into distinct memory keys (e.g.
  `email/preferences/github.com` vs a finer split if the manifest data supports one), or
- **Declines to aggregate** that portion this pass (leaves it as unresolved tally noise) rather
  than averaging into a false scalar.

The **review partition** (Stage 2.5 bucket, optimized for human bulk-approval ergonomics) and
the **memory partition** (Phase 2's normalized identity, optimized for durable preference
identity) are explicitly not required to be identical. One review bucket may fan out into
multiple memory-write candidates.

---

## 2. Identity Key Normalization + Real-Sample Verification (G2)

### 2.1 Manifest ground truth

`wrapper-contracts.md:43-47`/§3 confirms the manifest schema is
`{message_id, sender, subject, date, proposed_action, reason, confidence}` — `sender` is a
**bare, unnormalized string** with no contract for case, display-name wrapping, plus-addressing,
DMARC rewriting, or List-Id (there is **no `List-Id` field in the manifest schema at all** — see
§2.3 below).

### 2.2 Normalization rule (final)

```
key = normalize(sender):
  1. Extract the bare address from "Display Name <addr>" or bare "addr" forms
     (regex: [A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+)
  2. Lowercase the entire address
  3. Strip a plus-addressing tag from the local-part: "local+tag@domain" -> "local@domain"
  4. Primary key = "local-part@domain"
  5. Domain-rollup fallback: for NON-freemail/non-shared domains only, a caller MAY roll up to
     "@domain" (mirrors bulk-bucket-review.md's own freemail carve-out: gmail.com, yahoo.com,
     outlook.com, proton.me, and other shared/freemail domains are NEVER rolled up — each full
     address is its own key on those domains).
  6. List-Id preference: NOT IMPLEMENTABLE from the current manifest schema (§2.3) — deferred,
     documented as a residual limitation, not a design decision made "on paper only."
  7. DMARC-rewritten-forwarder caveat: documented in §2.4 with a real observed example.
```

### 2.3 Real-sample verification (performed during design, not deferred)

**Method**: `email-classify --account gmail --manifest-dir <scratch> --emit-tagged
"tag:proposed-delete or tag:proposed-archive or tag:proposed-unsure or tag:proposed-keep"`.
This is genuinely read-only (wrapper-contracts.md §10a: "No `notmuch tag` call anywhere in this
mode... idempotent and side-effect-free"), run against the account's existing `+proposed-*`
tags from prior classify passes (2,656 already-tagged messages present in the index at time of
verification). Output: 2,128 tagged messages re-emitted, **751 unique sender strings**.

Findings against each of the four edge classes named in the plan:

| Edge class | Observed? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Freemail vs corporate domains** | Yes | `gmail.com` alone spans 337 messages across many *distinct* real addresses (`benbrastmckie@gmail.com`, `99nicky@gmail.com`, `siyasiya@gmail.com`, `bengoldhaber@gmail.com`, `marielkgoddu@gmail.com`, ...). Domain-rollup on `gmail.com` would have silently merged unrelated humans — confirms the freemail carve-out (step 5) is load-bearing, not defensive-only. |
| **Plus-addressing** | Yes | 20 of 2,128 messages carry a `+tag` in the local-part, e.g. `invoice+statements+acct_1RszBH2StuRr0lbX@stripe.com`, `invoice+statements@mail.anthropic.com`, `nextplayso+should-you-join@substack.com`, `hello+nicky-and-ben-oct-2026@withjoy.com`. Notably these are **sender-side** tags (services encoding context into their own From address, not classic recipient-side tagging) — stripping collapses e.g. all Stripe invoice mail to `invoice@stripe.com`, which is the *correct* aggregation for a sender preference (the account-ID suffix is noise for "should I keep Stripe invoices"). |
| **List-Id vs From** | **Not present in sample** (structural, not sampling luck) | The manifest schema (`wrapper-contracts.md` §3) has no `List-Id` field — `email-classify` never captures it. "Prefer List-Id over From for lists" is therefore **not implementable today** without a wrapper-contract change (out of scope; the wrapper is frozen). Documented as a hard limitation, not a soft preference. |
| **DMARC-rewritten forwarders** | Yes | Gmail's automatic DMARC-compliance rewrite for mailing lists is directly visible: `"'Marta Bieńkiewicz' via guaranteed-safe-ai" <guaranteed-safe-ai@googlegroups.com>`, `Charith Premawardhana via Groupmuse <mail@groupmuse.com>`, `"Devin Caglayan via DocuSign" <dse_NA3@docusign.net>`. The stored key resolves to the **relay/list address** (e.g. `guaranteed-safe-ai@googlegroups.com`), not the original individual poster — for mailing-list traffic this is actually the *desired* aggregation (one preference per list, not per poster), but it means a corporate domain enforcing strict DMARC (`p=reject`) whose mail is relayed through a third party will key by the relay, not the origin domain. |

**Case-sensitivity** (bonus finding, not one of the four named classes but directly load-bearing
for step 2): the same real address recurs with inconsistent capitalization across messages,
e.g. `CorrAdmin1@spi-global.com` appears repeatedly in mixed case. Confirms the lowercase step
is necessary on real data, not merely defensive boilerplate.

### 2.4 Residual edge cases (documented, not resolved further)

- **List-Id unavailability** (§2.3): 822 must key uniformly off `From` (post-normalization);
  a future wrapper-contract change to capture `List-Id` is a prerequisite for the "prefer
  List-Id" refinement — out of 821/822 scope, noted as a limitation.
- **DMARC-relay keying**: accepted as correct-by-default for mailing-list traffic (aggregates by
  list identity, matching "one evolving memory per sender/domain"); flagged as a known
  divergence from "identity of the original human sender" for anyone who later wants
  per-poster granularity within a list.

### 2.5 Verification outcome

The normalization rule in §2.2 is **verified against real mail, not asserted on paper** — three
of four edge classes were directly observed with concrete examples; the fourth (List-Id) was
conclusively shown to be a schema-level gap rather than an untested hypothesis. This satisfies
the plan's Phase 2 verification requirement without invoking the provisional-unverified
fallback (Rollback/Contingency); the key ships as **verified**, not provisional.

---

## 3. Memory Schema, Tally Model, and Topic Namespace (G5, G7, Conflict-2 synthesis)

### 3.1 Reserved topic namespace

`email/preferences/{key}` where `{key}` is the Phase 2 normalized identity (§2.5), further
prefixed by account per the 822-scope recommendation (§5.5): `email/preferences/{account}/{key}`
e.g. `email/preferences/gmail/stripe.com` or `email/preferences/gmail/benbrastmckie-gmail-com`
(hashed local-part per §3.3).

### 3.2 Per-action tally (stored in the memory **body**, not frontmatter)

```
{delete_count, archive_count, keep_count, last_seen}
```

Stored as a small structured block in the markdown body (not frontmatter — frontmatter stays
flat per the existing convention: `title, created, tags, topic, source, modified, keywords,
summary, retrieval_count, last_retrieved`, verified via `memory/README.md:151-160` and by
inspecting a live memory file's frontmatter). The **dominant action is derived**, never a stored
scalar: `dominant = argmax(delete_count, archive_count, keep_count)`, ties broken by whichever
action has the more recent per-action `last_seen` (a per-action `last_seen` sub-field, not a
single scalar, is required to break ties correctly — see body template below).

This is the report's key mechanical synthesis: a contradicting confirm increments the *opposite*
counter, which can shift the derived dominant action without any bespoke decay/EWMA math and
without a new skill-memory API verb (Phase 4 §4.3).

### 3.3 Redaction decision (G5)

**Chosen**: `domain` stays plaintext; `local-part` is replaced by a stable, non-reversible hash
(`sha256(local-part)[:12]`) in the stored key, title, and body — plaintext addresses are never
written into the vault.

**Rationale**: `memory-retrieve.sh` (verified by reading the script) scores corpus-wide by
keyword overlap plus a topic/category bonus (lines 74-102) with **no namespace filter at all**
— before Phase 5's G4 fix ships, a plaintext email address in a preference memory's title/body
is exactly the kind of >4-char, non-stopword token that would pass the keyword filter and could
surface in an unrelated task's `<memory-context>`. Even after the G4 fix, hashing is
defense-in-depth: debugging only needs *consistency* (same input -> same hash, so a dominant
sender is recognizable across visits and the derived dominant-action trend is auditable), not
*reversibility* — an operator who genuinely needs the real address can cross-reference the
email extension's own notmuch tags/manifests, which retain it. Freemail/shared domains
therefore get `domain + hash(local-part)`; non-freemail domain-rollup keys (§2.2 step 5) need
no hash since they never carried a local-part.

### 3.4 `category: preference` frontmatter field (G7)

**Add now**, schema-additive and non-breaking. Verified via `grep -rl "^category:"
.memory/10-Memories/*.md` (0 of 19 existing memory files have this field — the `category` seen
in `memory-index.json` entries is a derived index-level field synthesized from `tags`, never a
real frontmatter field on any `.md` file today). This design is the first real use of a
frontmatter `category:` field. `index.md`/`/distill` should recognize `category:` when present
(preferring it over the tags-derived heuristic) and continue to fall back to the existing
tags-derivation when absent — never required, never breaking for the other 19 memories.

### 3.5 Memory body template

```markdown
---
title: "Email preference: {domain-or-hash-key}"
created: {today}
tags: [email, preference, {domain}]
topic: "email/preferences/{account}/{key}"
source: "skill-email-cleanup harvest"
modified: {today}
keywords: [{domain}, email, preference]
summary: "Confirmed-decision tally for {domain-or-hash-key}: {dominant_action} ({dominant_count}/{total})"
retrieval_count: 0
last_retrieved:
category: preference
---

# Email preference: {domain-or-hash-key}

**Tally**: delete={delete_count} (last: {delete_last_seen}), archive={archive_count}
(last: {archive_last_seen}), keep={keep_count} (last: {keep_last_seen})
**Dominant action** (derived): {dominant_action}
**Evidence**: junked {delete_count + archive_count}, kept {keep_count}

## History

- {date}: +{action} (n={n_this_round}, scope={inbox|archive})

## Connections
<!-- Add links to related memories using [[MEM-filename]] syntax -->
```

Schema fields map 1:1 to what Phase 4's operations read/write (verified below).

---

## 4. Deterministic Dedup + Operation Mapping (G3)

### 4.1 Exact-key dedup short-circuit

Before the existing fuzzy keyword-overlap path (`skill-memory/SKILL.md:200-206`: >60%
overlap=HIGH/UPDATE, 30-60%=MEDIUM/EXTEND, <30%=LOW/CREATE), the harvest runs an **exact
topic-key lookup**:

```bash
jq --arg k "email/preferences/${ACCOUNT}/${KEY}" \
  '.entries[] | select(.topic == $k)' .memory/memory-index.json
```

A hit short-circuits straight to UPDATE/EXTEND (§4.3) without ever computing keyword overlap.
This is a **sanctioned, explicitly documented deviation** from skill-memory's fuzzy 60%/30%
contract — the reserved `email/preferences/*` namespace opts out of fuzzy classification because
the identity key (Phase 2) is already a deterministic, verified normalization; re-deriving it
via keyword overlap would be strictly worse (fuzzier) than the key itself.

### 4.2 Fuzzy path retained as near-miss suggestion only

When no exact key matches, the existing fuzzy search still runs as a **suggestion**, e.g.
flagging `email/preferences/gmail/mail.foo.com` as a near-miss of an existing
`email/preferences/gmail/foo.com` entry — presented to the human at gate time (§5.4), never
auto-applied. Absent an exact match, the default action is CREATE.

### 4.3 Operation mapping

| Trigger | Operation | Tally effect |
|---|---|---|
| No exact-key match (first sighting) | **CREATE** | Initialize the tally: the confirmed action's counter = this round's count, other two = 0, `last_seen` set for that action only. |
| Exact-key match; this round's dominant action == stored dominant action | **EXTEND** | Append a dated `## History` line; bump the matching counter; update that action's `last_seen`. Existing content is never rewritten. |
| Exact-key match; this round's dominant action != stored dominant action | **UPDATE** | Increment the *opposite* counter (never overwrite/reset the matching one) — this can flip the *derived* dominant action per §3.2's tie-break rule; move the prior summary line to `## History` marked `(superseded)`. |

Contradiction handling is **tally arithmetic**, matching Conflict 2's resolution: no bespoke
decay/EWMA engine, no new skill-memory API verb — UPDATE/EXTEND/CREATE as they already exist,
applied to a body-level counter block instead of full-content replacement.

### 4.4 Batch index regeneration

Reuse skill-todo's batch-regen *logic* (`skill-todo/SKILL.md` harvest stages): **one**
`memory-index.json` regeneration after the entire harvest round (all buckets in one `--all`
sweep, or the single confirm set in one default-mode Stage 6 pass), not a regen per individual
CREATE/UPDATE/EXTEND call — matches how skill-todo already batches its own memory-harvest index
update rather than writing the index file once per candidate.

---

## 5. Retrieval/Distill Guardrails, Feedback-Loop Caps, Gate, and Scope Decisions (G4, G6)

### 5.1 G4 (part a) — `/distill` zero-retrieval exemption

`skill-memory/SKILL.md:995` (verified) and the purge sub-mode's OR-condition
(`skill-memory/SKILL.md:2042-2050`, verified) computes purge candidates as: `retrieval_count==0
AND days_since_created > 30`. **Chosen mechanism**: add a topic-prefix exemption to that
condition — `retrieval_count==0 AND days_since_created > 30 AND NOT topic starts_with
"email/preferences/"`. Rejected alternative: making email-side reads increment
`retrieval_count`. Rationale: `memory-retrieve.sh` is invoked only by `/research`/`/plan`/
`/implement` preflight (verified: no other caller exists in this repo); teaching
`skill-email-cleanup` to independently mutate `memory-index.json`'s `retrieval_count` on every
lookup introduces a second uncoordinated writer to that file for a benefit (staleness signal
accuracy) fully achievable with a one-line filter-scope addition to the existing purge query.

### 5.2 G4 (part b) — cross-contamination fix in `memory-retrieve.sh`

Verified: the scoring block (`memory-retrieve.sh:74-102`) has no namespace/task-type filter; the
`>4-char` stopword filter (line 54, 60) does not drop proper nouns (`github`, `google`,
`notifications` all pass). **Chosen mechanism**: add a pre-filter step before scoring —

```
map(select(
  ((.topic // "") | startswith("email/preferences/")) and ($tt != "email")
  | not
))
```

Since `/research`/`/plan`/`/implement` never invoke this script with `task_type == "email"`
(the email extension is direct-execution, not task-typed — confirmed no `email` task type
exists in the core routing table), this is effectively an **unconditional exclusion** from the
general auto-retrieval path today, while leaving the door open for a deliberate future
email-side reader to pass `task_type="email"` explicitly and see its own namespace.

### 5.3 G6 — feedback-loop guardrails

A stored preference may **only ever contribute as a surfaced tally** in the gate/bucket-review
prompt (e.g. "junked 14, kept 2 — no matching custom rule"), never by auto-setting
`proposed_action` or silently raising `confidence` past what `classify_one()`'s deterministic
rule table already computes (`wrapper-contracts.md` §5c, frozen constants). The vault stays
strictly advisory relative to the frozen classifier — this is what prevents automation bias from
entrenching an early mistake into a self-reinforcing loop. Reversal mechanism: Phase 4's tally
already accepts contradicting confirms via the UPDATE path (§4.3), so a wrong preference
self-corrects through ordinary continued use; no new "weaken/contradict" primitive is required
for correctness (a revocation/edit UX is a UX nicety, recommended for 822 scope in §5.5, not a
correctness requirement).

### 5.4 Gate behavior

One consolidated, **never-silent** `AskUserQuestion` prompt, adjacent to the just-approved
action (immediately following Stage 2.5 bucket approval in `--all` mode, or immediately
following Stage 6 Verify in default mode) — reusing skill-todo's harvest -> dedup -> tiered-gate
-> batch-regen **logic**, not its `state.json` substrate (§1.3):

- **Tier 1** (pre-selected): buckets/keys meeting the evidentiary threshold (§1.4) outright this
  round.
- **Tier 2** (shown, not pre-selected): keys newly crossing the rolling-N threshold this round.
- Fuzzy near-miss suggestions (§4.2) surfaced as a labeled option, not auto-selected.

Independent of the `--clean` flag: `--clean` only suppresses *auto-retrieval* for
`/research`/`/plan`/`/implement` preflight (per CLAUDE.md's Memory Extension section); it has no
relationship to this harvest-side *write* gate, which always runs when the evidentiary threshold
is met, `--clean` or not.

### 5.5 Scope decision — fold into 822 (not 823/824)

**Recommendation**: fold revocation/edit UX, cross-account scoping, archive-scope isolation, and
a minimal success-signal phase **into 822's scope**, rather than spawning separate tasks 823
(measurement/audit split) at this time. 822 is already queued and depends on 821
(`specs/state.json`: `project_number: 822`, `task_type: meta`, `dependencies: [821]`,
`status: not_started`) — the same batch this task belongs to. Rationale: each item below is
individually small (roughly one `AskUserQuestion` branch, one key-prefix decision, one flag
check, one log line) and tightly coupled to the write path 822 already builds; splitting into a
separate task would add coordination overhead (a new dependency edge, a second review pass) with
no corresponding benefit, unlike the *read-back* engine (§6, genuinely a second consumer/loop
closure — that one remains a real task-823 candidate) or the cross-client generalization note
(§7, explicitly speculative, not spawn-worthy today).

**Concrete additions recommended for 822's implementation plan**:

- **Cross-account key scoping**: prefix the stored key by account —
  `email/preferences/{gmail|logos}/{key}` — never collapse across accounts by default; gmail and
  logos are distinct mail identities that may have divergent sender behavior for what looks like
  "the same" domain.
- **Archive-scope isolation**: tag archive-scope-sourced confirms distinctly (a separate tally
  sub-section in the same memory, e.g. `### Archive-scope tally`, not a separate memory — this
  preserves the "one evolving memory per sender/domain" invariant while preventing a burst of
  old archive-triage confirms from silently dominating a sender's current-inbox dominant action).
- **Revocation/edit UX**: an explicit, user-invoked "forget this preference" action reusing the
  existing tombstone pattern (`skill-memory/SKILL.md:518`, `:1363`, verified) or a tally reset —
  never automatic, distinct from `/distill --purge`.
- **Minimal success signal**: log a per-round agreement rate (confirmed action == memory's
  pre-round derived dominant action, when a memory existed prior to the round) as a harvest log
  line — no new dashboard; enough visibility for a future audit to detect drift.

---

## 6. Future: Read-Back Contract (Not in 822's Scope) (G8/D1)

The loop as scoped through 822 is **one-directional** (write-only): the vault becomes a
preference *log*, not a preference *engine*, without a consumer. This section specs a named
contract so 822's write schema stays lookup-ready, seeding a future task 823:

```
email_preference_lookup(account, normalized_key)
  -> { dominant_action, confidence_tier, tally: {delete_count, archive_count, keep_count},
       last_seen } | null
```

**Intended future consumers** (not implemented by 822):

1. A new rule tier in `email-classify`'s classification, inserted between the `CUSTOM_*` rules
   and `NEWSLETTER_KEYWORDS` (wrapper-contracts.md §5c's tier table) — reading the vault at
   classify time to *advise*, subject to the same G6 cap (§5.3): it may only ever inform, never
   silently raise confidence past the frozen rule table's own output. This would require a
   wrapper-contract change (the wrapper is frozen) or a pre/post-processing layer outside the
   wrapper binary itself — out of scope to design further here.
2. A Stage 2.5 bucket-review advisory annotation ("this bucket has a stored vault preference:
   archive x14, delete x2 -> lean archive") shown alongside the bucket, purely informational,
   requiring no wrapper change since it only touches the skill's own presentation layer.

Filed as the seed for task 823. Not implemented in 822.

---

## 7. Deferred Design Notes (D4/D5) — Document, Do Not Adopt

- **Generalizing the confirmed-decision -> preference harvest pattern beyond email** (fix-it
  triage, task-abandonment reasons, PR-review nits): the pattern is plausible but should only be
  extracted once a **second real client** justifies it — email stays "the first client." Do not
  speculatively generalize the `email/preferences/{key}` namespace or harvest logic now.
- **Notmuch-ruleset export** (flag only, do not adopt): would strengthen loop-closure but
  changes the human-gated safety posture this entire design protects — a preference memory
  silently becoming an executable notmuch rule bypasses the review gate. Any future exploration
  of this must re-litigate the safety model from scratch, not extend this design.
- **Local-model training-data use of preference memories** (flag only, do not adopt): raises
  consent/redaction questions beyond this task's scope; the §3.3 hashing decision was made for
  in-repo leakage prevention, not for training-data-safe anonymization, and should not be
  mistaken for the latter.

## 8. `email-preferences.md` Remains a Distinct, Parallel Layer

`.claude/extensions/email/context/project/email/email-preferences.md` is a **historical harvest
document** recording the prior-art static classifier rule table (custom domain-delete rules,
keyword-fallback tiers) — the live compiled constants it describes
(`CUSTOM_KEEP_SENDERS`/`CUSTOM_DELETE_DOMAINS`/`NEWSLETTER_KEYWORDS`/`NOTIFICATION_DOMAINS`) live
in the frozen `~/.dotfiles/modules/home/email/agent-tools.nix` wrapper (wrapper-contracts.md
§5c). The vault preference layer designed here is **parallel and agent-visible**, never
auto-written into that compiled table. Any future promotion of a vault-derived preference into
the classifier's hardcoded rules is a distinct, separately human-reviewed action (e.g. a
deliberate "promote to custom rule" step a human runs manually against the `.dotfiles` repo) —
never automatic, and out of scope for both 821 and 822.

## Summary: G1-G8 Resolution Index

| Gap | Resolved in | One-line resolution |
|---|---|---|
| G1 (evidentiary threshold) | §1.4 | Uniform-batch OR rolling N>=3 at >=80%, evaluated against the stored tally. |
| G2 (identity key + verification) | §2 | `lower(local@domain)`, plus-tag stripped, freemail never rolled up; verified against 2,128 real tagged messages. |
| G3 (deterministic dedup) | §4.1-4.3 | Exact `topic==` short-circuit before fuzzy; CREATE/EXTEND/UPDATE mapped to tally arithmetic. |
| G4 (namespace segregation, distill exemption, cross-contamination) | §5.1-5.2 | Purge-filter topic-prefix exemption; `memory-retrieve.sh` topic-prefix pre-filter. |
| G5 (redaction) | §3.3 | Domain plaintext, local-part hashed (`sha256[:12]`). |
| G6 (feedback-loop guardrails) | §5.3 | Advisory-only surfacing, capped below the frozen classifier's own confidence; tally itself is the reversal mechanism. |
| G7 (`category: preference` field) | §3.4 | Added now, schema-additive, first real use of the field. |
| G8 (read-back contract) | §6 | Named `email_preference_lookup` contract, seeded for task 823, not implemented in 822. |

## Non-Goals Reaffirmed

No production code was written for this document. `email-preferences.md`'s static rule table is
untouched. The frozen wrapper (`~/.dotfiles/modules/home/email/agent-tools.nix`) was read
read-only for verification and was not modified. The one live-mail interaction performed during
design (§2.3) was a verified read-only `--emit-tagged` call — no `notmuch tag`, no maildir
mutation, no `--execute` invocation of any wrapper.
