# Email Implementation Skill

Thin wrapper that delegates email triage/cleanup implementation to the `email-implementation-agent`
subagent. This skill never calls the wrapper binaries itself — it only prepares delegation
context and dispatches.

## Trigger Conditions

This skill activates when:
- Task type is "email"
- `/implement` command targets an email task
- A census/classify/archive/delete/unsubscribe-extract plan needs wrapper-only execution

## Execution Flow

### Stage 1: Input Validation

Validate task_number exists, task_type is "email", and an implementation plan is present.

### Stage 2: Preflight Status Update

Update status to "implementing" BEFORE invoking the subagent.

### Stage 3: $PATH Precondition Check (contract §9)

Before dispatching, verify the five wrapper binaries are on `$PATH`:

```bash
command -v email-census email-classify email-archive-confirmed email-delete-confirmed \
  email-unsubscribe-extract
```

If any are missing, do NOT dispatch. Write `status: "failed"` metadata naming the missing
binary and instructing the user to run `home-manager switch --flake .#<user>` to activate the
generation containing `modules/home/email/agent-tools.nix`.

### Stage 4: Prepare Delegation Context

Domain-specific context for `email-implementation-agent`:
- Wrapper-only contract: only the five named binaries, never raw `himalaya`/`notmuch`/`msmtp`/
  `secret-tool`, never `rm` against Maildir.
- Propose-review-confirm-execute: STOP at every review gate for explicit human approval before
  any `--execute --confirm-manifest <sha256>` call.
- Constants: `MAX_BATCH_SIZE=50`, `PLAN_EXPIRY_DAYS=7`, delete auto-propose confidence `>= 0.90`.

```json
{
  "session_id": "sess_{timestamp}_{random}",
  "delegation_depth": 1,
  "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "implement", "skill-email-implementation"],
  "timeout": 7200,
  "task_context": {
    "task_number": N,
    "task_name": "{project_name}",
    "description": "{description}",
    "task_type": "email"
  },
  "plan_path": "specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/plans/MM_{short-slug}.md",
  "metadata_file_path": "specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/.return-meta.json"
}
```

### Stage 5: Invoke Subagent

Use Agent tool with subagent_type: "email-implementation-agent".

### Stage 5b: Self-Execution Fallback

**CRITICAL**: If you performed work above WITHOUT using the Agent tool, you MUST write a
`.return-meta.json` file now before proceeding to postflight, per `return-metadata-file.md`.
This is not expected for email tasks — the wrapper-only contract is agent-owned, so the fallback
path here must still respect Stage 3's `$PATH` check and never invoke a wrapper binary directly
from this skill.

If you DID use the Agent tool, skip this stage.

## Postflight (ALWAYS EXECUTE)

### Stage 6: Parse Subagent Return

Read the metadata file from `specs/{N}_{SLUG}/.return-meta.json`.

### Stage 7: Update Task Status (Postflight)

Update state.json and TODO.md based on result.

### Stage 8: Link Artifacts

Add artifact to state.json with summary. Update TODO.md per
`@.claude/context/patterns/artifact-linking-todo.md`.

### Stage 9: Git Commit

Commit changes with session ID.

### Stage 10: Return Brief Summary

Return 3-6 bullets. State clearly whether any mutation (`--execute`) occurred and, if so, which
manifest/sha256 authorized it.

---

## MUST NOT (Postflight Boundary)

After the agent returns, this skill MUST NOT:

1. **Call any wrapper binary directly** - All classify/archive/delete/unsubscribe execution is
   done by the dispatched agent, wrapper-only, per the email extension's safety invariants
2. **Run build/test commands** - Verification is done by the dispatched agent
3. **Use MCP/WebSearch tools** - Domain tools are for the dispatched agent's use only
4. **Analyze or grep source** - Analysis is dispatched-agent work
5. **Write manifests or reports** - Artifact creation is dispatched-agent work

The postflight phase is LIMITED TO:
- Reading agent metadata file
- Calling `update-task-status.sh` for status updates (state.json + TODO.md)
- Linking artifacts in state.json
- Cleanup of temp/marker files
