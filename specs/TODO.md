857 [NOT STARTED] — Harden the <leader>me aerc launch gate in lua/neotex/plugins/tool

## Tasks

### 857. Reindex-on-failure for the aerc launch gate
- **Effort**: small
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Task Type**: neovim
- **Topic**: neovim
- **Dependencies**: None

**Description**: Harden the <leader>me aerc launch gate in lua/neotex/plugins/tools/mail.lua so a failed `mbsync -a` no longer leaves notmuch stale before the freshness decision, providing a minimal, durable fix without unnecessary complexity.

CURRENT BEHAVIOR (verified in mail.lua): sync_all_mail() runs `notmuch new` ONLY when `mbsync -a` exits 0; on mbsync failure it notifies the error and returns via on_done(false) WITHOUT reindexing. The gate itself already refuses-and-reports rather than failing open -- it opens aerc only on a clean sync+reindex, or when census_freshness_ok() reads [ok] on BOTH accounts, otherwise it refuses with remediation guidance. That refuse-and-report barrier is sound and must be preserved.

GAP TO FIX (the real durable change): on the mbsync-failure path, run `notmuch new` BEFORE the freshness decision, so maildir files that already landed on disk -- or mailboxes that synced before an abort such as a duplicate-UID collision -- get reconciled into the index. Then let the existing authoritative barrier make the launch decision against a freshly reindexed state instead of a stale one.

SCOPE CONSTRAINTS:
- Keep the change minimal and cohesive (one function/gate); do not duplicate freshness logic that belongs in the external census wrapper.
- Preserve the existing refuse-and-report barrier and its remediation messaging.
- The fallback signal census_freshness_ok() reads the "INBOX freshness ... [ok]" line, a count-with-tolerance proxy that cannot detect flag-renames or phantom drift -- this is what produced the false green. Making that signal authoritative is an EXTERNAL follow-up in ~/.dotfiles modules/home/email/agent-tools/census.nix (rename/deletion-aware freshness) and is intentionally OUT OF SCOPE here. Document the dependency in the gate's comment so a future reader knows the barrier's trustworthiness rests on that external signal.

OUT OF SCOPE (context only, no repo change, no commit): one-time ~/Mail data repair for the duplicate UID 15 collision in Gmail/.All_Mail, and the one-time `notmuch new` index reconciliation of the ~38-file INBOX phantom drift. These are manual mail-data operations, not code.
